# S-and-P-box
## Description of functionality
<ol>
  <li>sboxencrypt/sboxdecrypt refer to s-box encryption algorithm, forward and reverse text transformation algorithms.</li>
  <li>sboxencrypt/sboxdecrypt refer to s-box encryption algorithm, forward and reverse text transformation algorithms.
pboxencrypt/pboxdecrypt forward and reverse p-box conversion algorithm.</li>
</ol>
The main_test.go file demonstrates the correctness of the algorithms by comparing the original message with the decrypted ciphertext message.<br>
<b>Note:</b><br> pbox algorithm accepts strings of 8 characters only!
